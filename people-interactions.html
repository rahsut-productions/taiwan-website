        If you asked a person, "Where is Taiwan?", do you think they would know? Do they even know it's an Asia? Have they even heard of Taiwan? If you answered no to any of those questions, then the problem shows. Americans and people from other places are not knowledgeable about this small island. People need to interact with people in this island so it can have a place on the international stage. Taiwan is shunned away by politics, and the people get left behind. Being friends, interacting, and supporting the Taiwanese people is a step you can take.  </p>
