      <p>Taiwan was ruled by the Qing dynsasty from 1683-1895, more than 200 years! The Qing Dynasty, at the time, was the ruling government of China. But, the Qing dynasty lost Taiwan to the Empire of Japan in 1895. Japan ruled Taiwan, while also attacking mainland China and other countries, in an attempt to take over the world. In 1947, the island of Taiwan gets taken over by the Republic of China government. The Republic of China was the new Chinese government, bringing an end to dynastys, and taking over China. But, the Chinese civil war took place between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang (the Nationalist Party of China). The R.O.C. government then fled to the island of Taiwan. The Communist Party took over the entirety of mainland China, establishing the People's Republic of China, on October 1st, 1949. The People's Republic of China claims Taiwan as a part of China and because of this reason, other countries do not want to interact with Taiwan because of trade deals and economic prosperity from the PRC. </p>

      <p class="text-align-left">It has been over 70 years since the ROC government fled to Taiwan. The ruling party of Taiwan is the Democratic Progressive Party of Taiwan and people have changed. Most people don't really care about if Taiwan is a country or not, or any of this political nonsense. The Taiwanese people just want to be accepted. Countries like India, Russia, Brazil, United States, etc. don't have much formal diplomacy with Taiwan. This has hurt the Taiwanese economy. If we open up to Taiwan, start cultural programmes, trade, visit, and actually interact with Taiwan, we can open up a brand new culture that has been locked for a very long time. More information about this goes around the page.</p>
