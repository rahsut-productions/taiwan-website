        Most Countries in the world treat Taiwan as 'non-existent.' The reason for this lies in the fact that, better trade deals can be activated through not interacting with Taiwan (as to not provoke China (PRC)). Some countries do interact with Taiwan but then suddenly stop. They do this as to make China happier and to have infastructure programmes come to their countries. Most countries in the world have this interaction with Taiwan. Not all countries do though. Belize is one of the few countries that doesn't interact with China but with Taiwan.</p>

      <p class="text-align-left">We need to interact with Taiwan. This doesn't have to be through trading or economical reasons but more of humane and cultural reasons. Taiwan is not allowed to join the World Health Organization and this has caused problems during this COVID-19 pandemic. Taiwan is not allowed to have cultural programmes set in a lot of countries because those countries won't  allow it. This isn't a political issue, this is a cultural and humane issue. We can't let Taiwanese people die because they're not allowed to get medical for not being apart of the WHO. We can't have Taiwan not share their culture. Some people look for happiness in other places in the world and Taiwan could be one! If we spread their culture, our own citizens of our respective countries would be happier. Our own countries will get special cuisine from Taiwan which, the respective countries can tax (big revenue stream). These are just a few examples but a lot more issues have arrived from neglection like this.</p>
