        This page is about spreading information about Taiwan and spreading information on how Taiwan should be treated. In the world, Taiwan is treated as a non-existent place. A place that most countries and organisations don't want to mention. The mission of this page is to bring light to this little island and bring friendships between different countries, organisations, and states with Taiwan. This page is not affiliated wtih the Republic of China (Taiwan) and is not designed to bring political bias. All complaints can be filed at <a href="mailto:tusharpassi17@gmail.com">tusharpassi17@gmail.com</a></p>
